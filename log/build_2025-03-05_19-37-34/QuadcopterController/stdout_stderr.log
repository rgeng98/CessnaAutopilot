[31mCMake Error at src/CMakeLists.txt:3 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgz-msgs8.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "gz-msgs8",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gz-msgs8" with any
  of the following names:

    gz-msgs8Config.cmake
    gz-msgs8-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gz-msgs8" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gz-msgs8_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "gz-msgs8" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.

[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /usr/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (PkgConfig)
  does not match the name of the calling package (gazebo).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:99 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/gazebo/gazebo-config.cmake:72 (include)
  CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
